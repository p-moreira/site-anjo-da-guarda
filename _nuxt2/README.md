# PWA - Associação Anjo da Guarda

Associação Anjos da Guarda is migrating you old site (https://anjodaguardaprojeto.wixsite.com/anjo) to a new modern PWA app: https://projetoanjodaguarda.org

## 🎉 Getting Started

**How to run the project**

1. 👯‍♂️ Clone the repository locally and cd into the directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/associacao-anjo-da-guarda/anjo-da-guarda.git

cd anjo-da-guarda
```

2. 📦 Install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

3. 🏗 Run the project for local dev. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`.

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. ⚡️ Generate a full static site. See more [in the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/going-full-static).

```bash
yarn build && yarn export
```

> We migrate the first version from Netlify CMS to Prismic (https://prismic.io). So, all content is fetched using Prismic Graphql
